# DrowsinessDetectionSystem
Code to calculate the drowsiness level of students and professionals. Then it will play an alarm when it detects you are sleepy

# Introduction
We all know the problem, we tend to fall asleep when reading something on our computers or tablets. But the test that you are learning for is really important and you really should pay attention. Now your computer can help you to stay awake.
Picture this, you are reading, just ate, and sitting really comfortably and warm. Your eyes are getting heavy, and eventually you just let your eyes close for a second. Then you hear the loudest noise ever. When you open your eyes, you see the screen of your computer flickering with the brightest colors. Immediately you press a button on your computer to make the annoying noise stop.
We came up with this idea, because we know that this is a common problem that students have to deal with, and we wanted to try to prevent this from happening anymore.
